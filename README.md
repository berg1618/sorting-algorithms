# sorting-algorithms
In code folder you will find two files: 
- generate_random: code used to generate arrays with random numbers for the tests;
- sorting_comparing: code of the six algorithms tested and its main execution

There are still some other files with the arrays generated, so you can copy test it yourself

To compile, use:
```
g++ ./code/sorting_comparing.cpp
```
To run, use
```
./a.out
```
