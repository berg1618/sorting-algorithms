# sorting-algorithms
In code folder you will find two files: 
- generate_random: code used to generate arrays with random numbers for the tests;
- sorting_comparing: code of the six algorithms tested(merge, quick, shell, insertion, bubble and selection sort) and its main execution

Ihere are still some other files with the arrays generated, so you can copy test it yourself

To compile, use:
```
g++ ./code/sorting_comparing.cpp
```
To run, use
```
./a.out
```
